# tweet-template
A HTML, CSS, JS build template of Twitter tweets
I was working on a blospost where I had to create a curated list of some valuable tweets. Embedding the tweets using Twitter embeds made the webpage hella slow and slaggish. Then I found some static tweet React libraries but they weren't a way to go with Blogger. So, I had to make a Tweet template. It's responsive and looks native to Twitter.
